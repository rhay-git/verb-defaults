# verb-defaults [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/verb-defaults.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/verb-defaults) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/verb-defaults.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/verb-defaults) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/verbose/verb-defaults.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/verbose/verb-defaults)

Plugin for setting basic defaults in verb projects.

You might also be interested in [generate](https://github.com/generate/generate).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save verb-defaults
```

## What does this do?

**Default engine**

Adds a default [template engine](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/engine-base) for rendering templates. This engine is registered with the name `*`.

In a vinyl stream, to force rendering to use this engine, do:

```js
app.src('*.md')
  .pipe(app.renderFile('*')) //<= engine name
```

**Common middleware**

Registers the [common-middleware](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/common-middleware) plugin, which runs `preRender`, `posRender` and `preWrite` middleware that handle escaping and unescaping of templates/delimiters that should not be evaluated at render time (e.g. when writing documentation it's common to have examples of templates that should not be rendered).

## Usage

This plugin can be used in a `verbfile.js` or a globally installed verb generator.

```js
var defaults = require('verb-defaults');

// register the plugin
app.use(defaults());
```
